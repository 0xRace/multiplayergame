# Project Progress

## Completed Steps

### Step 3: Server Setup (Completed)
- Created server directory with Node.js and TypeScript configuration
- Installed required dependencies: Express, Socket.IO, TypeScript, and development tools
- Implemented basic Express server with health check endpoint at `/status`
- Set up Socket.IO for future real-time game state synchronization
- Added development scripts for building and running the server
- Server runs on port 3001 by default

## Next Steps
- Step 4: Install and Configure Phaser
- Implement client-side game engine
- Set up responsive game canvas

## Testing Status
- Server health check endpoint implemented and ready for testing
- Basic Socket.IO connection handling in place

## Phase 1: Project Setup

- Configured Jest for testing with 100% coverage requirement
- Created sample utility and test to verify setup
- All tests passing with 100% coverage
- Initial commit completed

**Completed on:** [Current Date]

**Test Status:** ✅ All tests passing
- Sample math utility test suite: 3 tests passing
- 100% code coverage achieved

### Step 2: Scaffold Client with Vite ✅
- Created client directory using Vite's TypeScript template
- Installed Phaser 3.70.0 for game engine
- Set up responsive game canvas
- Configured basic scene structure
- Removed unnecessary React template files
