# Tech Stack Recommendation

A minimal but solid stack to get our MMO snake arena up and running quickly, while remaining maintainable and scalable.

---

## 1. Language & Tooling
- **TypeScript** (both client & server)
- **Vite** for fast dev server & bundling

## 2. Client
- **Phaser 3**  
  - Lightweight 2D game engine with built-in physics and asset handling
- **HTML5 Canvas API** (via Phaser)
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Vite** for module bundling & hot reload

## 3. Server
- **Node.js** (LTS)
- **Express.js** or **Fastify** (minimal HTTP + WebSocket upgrade)
- **Socket.IO**  
  - Easy real-time bi-directional communication  
- **TypeScript**

## 4. Data & Persistence
- **In-memory state** for real-time positions & health
- **Redis** (optional)  
  - Pub/sub for scaling across multiple server instances  
  - Persistent leaderboard storage

## 5. DevOps & Deployment
- **Docker**  
  - Containerize client & server for consistent environments
- **GitHub Actions**  
  - CI: lint, build, test
  - CD: deploy to staging/production
- **Hosting**  
  - Heroku, DigitalOcean App Platform, or AWS ECS/EKS

## 6. Testing & Monitoring
- **Jest** for unit & integration tests
- **Playwright** or **Cypress** for end-to-end tests
- **Sentry** or **Prometheus/Grafana** (optional) for error tracking and metrics

This stack strikes a balance between simplicity, strong TypeScript typing, and the ability to scale as our player base grows. Feel free to tweak any component as we move from MVP to production.
