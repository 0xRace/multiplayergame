# Project Structure Guide

This workspace is organized as follows:

- Root
  - `.gitattributes` – Git attributes configuration.
  - `memory-bank/` – project documentation.

- Documents
  - [tech-stack.md](mdc:memory-bank/tech-stack.md)  
    Contains the recommended technology stack (TypeScript, Vite, Phaser 3, Node.js, Socket.IO, Redis, Docker, etc.).
  - [game-design-document.md](mdc:memory-bank/game-design-document.md)  
    Describes high-level vision, mechanics, networking architecture, UI/UX, milestones, and roadmap.

**Usage Guidelines**  
- When you need details on tool choices or setup, consult the tech-stack file.  
- For gameplay rules, mechanics, and design decisions, refer to the game design document.  

- As development proceeds, source code directories (e.g. `client/`, `server/`) will appear at the workspace root; create corresponding rules under `.cursor/rules` to map new files and directories.
