# Project Structure Guide

This workspace is organized as follows:

- Root
  - `.gitattributes` – Git attributes configuration.
  - `memory-bank/` – project documentation.


# Memory Bank directory contains key project documentation for the multiplayer game project. Each file serves a specific purpose in gui, and technology choices.

- @implementation-plan.md: Step-by-step implementation roadmap, breaking down the project into concrete, testable phases from setup to deployment.
- @game-design-document.md: High-level game design, including vision, mechanics, networking, UI/UX, milestones, and risk management.
- @tech-stack.md: Recommended technology stack for client, server, deployment, and testing, with rationale for each choice.
- @progress.md: (Currently empty) Intended for tracking project progress or milestones.
- @architecture.md: (Currently empty) Reserved for future architectural diagrams or technical overviews.

**Usage:**
- Refer to these documents for authoritative guidance on project setup, design decisions, and technology selection.
- Update this rule as new documentation files are added or existing ones are populated with content.
- Update documents in memory-bank any time relevant changes or additions are made to the project 
  

- As development proceeds, source code directories (e.g. `client/`, `server/`) will appear at the workspace root; create corresponding rules under `.cursor/rules` to map new files and directories.
